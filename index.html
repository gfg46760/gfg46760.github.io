<span style="font-style:italic"> UGA Miracle </span> is a philanthropic organization that is entirely run by students here at the University of Georgia! Members of UGA Miracle work hand in hand with both large and small donors across the country in order to raise as much money for the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta as possible. 
<p> Although UGA Miracle mainly ecompasses those members of the University Campus that are also involved in Greek Life, do not let this deter you! <strong>UGA Miracle has plenty of other members from all aspects of all parts of campus.</strong>
<p> Now, I bet you're wondering. How much money can a group of college kids actually raise? Well, you'd be <em>surprised</em>.

<p> In 2017 alone, UGA Miracle raised a total of <b>$1,352,705.17!</b>
<p> How awesome is that!?

<p> In fact, by raising that much money, UGA Miracle was actually deemed that year's largest donor to the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta!
<p> Overall, UGA Miracle has helped the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta raise millions of dollars over the years. And we want <em>YOU</em> to be apart of our journey!
